                <h3>IBM India Private Limited</h3>
                <h4>DevOps Engineer</h4>
                <p>
                    As an DevOps Engineer, I worked on the automation of CI/CD scripts using dev tools. I am working with multiple clients. Responsible for design and implementation of end to end automated delivery for multiple applications. Also, I am a part of the open banking, Digital Platform, and DevOps team in the Bendigo project. I am responsible for managing Dev tools and managing deployments. I worked on different tools. I worked on multiple Deployment and Integration tools. As well I worked on multiple Image repositories and Binary management tools. My primary work is to manage deployments. I am working on GitLab for Source Code Management and the same we are using as Integration and deployment tools as well but initially, we used to have GitHub as SCM and Jenkins as Integration tool and Ansible as Deployment tool. For the Image registry now we are using Jfrog but initially, we used to have IBM cloud Image Registry. In this project, I am responsible for the installation of Integration tools like Jenkins, Deployment tools like Ansible, and management of them. In this project, I deployed code on IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service platforms and now deploying on Amazon Web Services platform. I was responsible for the installation of Integration tools like Jenkins, Deployment tools like Urban Code Deploy, and Ansible. Also, the Image repository setup is done by me like JFrog and Nexus. For source code management we used Github. Even my role was to set up deployment environments like Kubernetes cluster and docker environment. Even I did deployment on single standalone VM's as well. I did the setup of ELK, Grafana, Prometheus, Zipkin, vault, and JIRA also management was with me for all this.
